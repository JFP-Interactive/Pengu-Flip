# Pengu Flip
## Help poor Pengu eat some fish!

Get ready to embark on the most hilariously slippery adventure of your life with "Pengu Flip"!

Join a penguin's exhilarating journey down a glacier, where your smarts are the key to its wild ride.

In this escapade, control is in your hands, but not as you'd expect. Place objects and boosters to guide our penguin protagonist, avoiding holes and catching fish for points. Watch as your strategic placements lead to comical slides, making each game uniquely funny and challenging.

Controls Overview:
- Object Placement: Use your mouse to place objects on the glacier. The object will appear where your pointer is located. To rotate the object, simply use the mouse wheel.
- Selecting Objects: Press the 'A', 'S', or 'D' keys to choose between three randomly provided objects for placement.
- Time Control: Slow down time by holding the 'Ctrl' (or shift in web) key. This can help in making precise placements and adjustments.
- Jump Feathers: Collect jump feathers during gameplay. Once collected, use the 'Space' bar to activate them and help the penguin leap over obstacles or reach higher areas.
